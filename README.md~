KrümelMonsta
=============

RubyPcap based Network Traffic sniffer designed to make relevant Information easy acessable.
It's not very useful yet but it can be used for http package anaylzing already. The idea behind the script is to make a new experience network sniffer. On its own it just handles your local traffic but with the help of ettercap or similar you can use a script like this for many many purposes. Also note its made for gatherling Information it cant infect or manipulate Packets, but you can write additional Moduls to get several types of Information.
